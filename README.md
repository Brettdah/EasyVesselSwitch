# Easy Vessel Switch (EVS)

The stock game doesn't care much about the camera stabilization when you switch between the vessels. You can walk in EVA, enter a pod, and end up with a camera looking in the sky. Or you may want to take a closer look at some part of your big station, but the camera focus is
bound to the station's center of mass, and the part of the interest is far away form it.

This mod can help you solving these troubles! With EVS:

* ...the camera will stop jumping around randomly. There are two modes of stabilization that allow preserving the view in the scene (switch with `F7`)...
* ...you're able to focus the view on any part of any vessel with a simple mouse click (with `O` hold, it's configurable)...
* ...a new active vessel can be selected by simply holding `ALT` (configurable) and clicking on the vessel you like...
* ...the basic info of a vessel can be quickly seen by simply hovering over it (with `ALT` hold)...

And this mod speaks 4 major languages in case of some of your kerbals are picky in this sense.
